# ICS Quadratic Grader - Joshua Mwila

This is a simple web page I made for the ICT251 assignment.  
It can solve a quadratic equation (ax² + bx + c = 0) and also convert a numeric score to a letter grade.

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the file *index.html* in any web browser.
3. Everything runs offline — no internet needed.

## Features
- Finds the discriminant (D = b² - 4ac)
- Shows the nature of roots (real or complex)
- Displays the two roots or the repeated root
- Converts score (0–100) into a letter grade:
  - A+: 85–100  
  - A: 75–84  
  - B+: 65–74  
  - B: 60–64  
  - C+: 55–59  
  - C: 50–54  
  - D: 0–49  

## Example Tests
- a=1, b=5, c=6 → Roots: -2 and -3  
- a=1, b=2, c=1 → One repeated root: -1  
- Score 85 → Grade A+  
- Score 49 → Grade D
